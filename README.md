# Poke-Data-Structures

This program is a recreation of a Pokédex where users can add, delete, consult, and modify Pokémon, regions, generations, and ID numbers. While a graphical interface simplifies initial data input and selection, users will primarily interact with the program through the console interface for data recovery and consultation operations.

Before adding Pokémon, users must input information related to region, generation, and ID to prevent errors. The graphical interface simplifies data entry and navigation, providing easy access to functions for managing Pokémon and related data.
